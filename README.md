# 🌟 Empowering Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT
### Fine-Tuning for Real-World Impact on IMDb Reviews

In a world where understanding customer sentiment drives impactful decisions, I embarked on a journey to fine-tune **DistilBERT** for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. From leveraging pre-trained models to optimizing performance for real-world applications, this project was a blend of innovation, challenges, and learning.

## 💡 Project Highlights

🔹 Fine-tuned the `distilbert-base-uncased` model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative  
🔹 Achieved ~85% accuracy on a subset of the IMDb dataset (1,000 training, 200 test samples)  
🔹 Tuned learning rate (3e-5) & trained for 5 epochs to improve results
